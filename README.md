# hello-world
Doing the hello-world guide on creating a repository.

Jenny here. This is what I do with my spare time. I'm a former support engineer turned stay-at-home-Mom. I'm currently doing the [FreeCodeCamp curriculum](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) to freshen up and gain more knowledge. I've always loved coding and I seem to be in my element when I'm deep in a project.

Git is another tool I need to utilitize so here I am. Hello World!!
